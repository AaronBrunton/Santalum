Genomic Comparisons in an Austral-Pacific Sandalwood (Santalaceae) Complex.
This repository contains the genomic data used in the article titled "Genomic comparisons in an Austral-Pacific sandalwood (Santalaceae) complex highlights novel clades, divergent groups, 
and the conservation dynamics of critically endangered and non-threatened lineages." This dataset forms the foundation of our analysis on genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationships, 
and conservation status within the sandalwood complex found in the Austral-Pacific region.

Overview
In this study, we investigate the genomic relationships among different lineages of sandalwood species, focusing on:

Identifying novel clades within the Santalaceae family.
Understanding the genetic divergence between populations.
Examining the conservation dynamics of critically endangered and non-threatened lineages.
This repository provides the raw SNP data and filtered genlight object, which includes sequence files and associated metadata, that was used for the analysis described in the paper.
